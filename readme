Program uses OPENCV to do speed detection.
Sequence to run files :
1- Put all files in same folder.
2- IP webcam address can be added in cv2.VideoCapture()
set_regions.py [to make mask on road ] should be run first. IMPORTANT: You need to make 2 masks.

run_TDI_Final.py calculates the speed of vehicle on road, USER INPUT required [Speed_Limit,distance, Angle]

1- Can work for all angles with respect to road.
2- Auto calibrates the detection range basis different speed limits.
Code has been tested on ground truth videos and is giving very good results.


FUTURE IMPROVEMENT:
A) Adjust crop rate of defaulters.
B) Integrate with NIGHT TIME DETECTION
