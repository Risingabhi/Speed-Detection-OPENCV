Program uses OPENCV to do speed detection.
Sequence to run files :
1- In this repo the most important step will be arrangement of files in to a single folder 
line.py, set_regions.py, run_TDI_Final.py with the prompt images 
2- create a proper environment containing opencv, python 3.8(recommended)and tensorflow 
3- IP webcam address can be added in cv2.VideoCapture("rtsp....")
4- After the above steps run first run the set_regions.py file on the env.
4.(a) creating of masks on the road (2 masks making are required) using required path files to get an output in with name regions.p(default)
5. Run the final file name run_TDI_Final.py and count the speed of the vehicles.
5.(a) speed_limit, distance, angle (as input)
.
6 - Auto calibrates the detection range basis different speed limits.
Code has been tested on ground truth videos and is giving very good results.


FUTURE IMPROVEMENT:
A) Adjust crop rate of defaulters.
B) Integrate with NIGHT TIME DETECTION
